# Wrangling-OpenStreetMap-Data-with-MongoDB
In one of my other projects I need to make use of street names and business registration information available in OpenStreetMap. 
This is an attempt to clean up the crowd-sourced dataset.


Read WranglingOpenStreetMapDatawithMongoDB.pdf for an overview of what I've done. Use cleaner.py to audit and fix the issues with various fields.
